-- LuaSignal - Signal handling library for Lua 5.1
module "signal"
---
-- Set a signal handler.
-- @param signal  String name of the signal to be handled (i.e. INT, ALRM)
-- @param handler Function to be called when the signal is received. Also, the
--                string "ignore" can be passed to cause the signal to be
--                ignored, "default" to cause the signal to use Lua's default
--                handler, and "cdefault" to cause the signal to use your
--                system's default behavior (since Lua overrides some signal
--                handlers to provide things like error messages and stack
--                traces)
function signal(signal, handler)

-- Pause program execution for a given amount of time. This is a thin wrapper
-- around the alarm() POSIX function.
-- @param  signal String name of the signal to be handled (i.e. INT, ALRM)
-- @return See your system's man page for the alarm() function
function alarm(signal)
---
-- Send a signal to a process. This is a thin wrapper around the kill() POSIX
-- function.
-- @param  pid    PID of the process to receive the signal
-- @param  signal String name of the signal to be handled (i.e. INT, ALRM)
-- @return See your system's man page for the kill() function
function kill(pid, signal)
---
-- Send a signal to the current process. This is a thin wrapper around the
-- raise() POSIX function.
-- @param  signal String name of the signal to be handled (i.e. INT, ALRM)
-- @return See your system's man page for the raise() function

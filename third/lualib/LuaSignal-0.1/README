LuaSignal v0.1
Jesse Luehrs (jluehrs2@uiuc.edu)

OVERVIEW
========
LuaSignal is a library for handling and generating POSIX signals from within
Lua.

INSTALL
=======
To install, modify Make.config to point to the appropriate paths, then type
'make' and 'make install'.

DOCUMENTATION
=============
API documentation can be found in the doc/ directory. It was autogenerated from the source files by LuaDoc (http://luadoc.luaforge.net/).

A few things to be aware of when using LuaSignal:
- LuaSignal is not reentrant, since it keeps the active Lua state in a global
  variable to be accessed from the signal handler. Therefore, it is not safe to
  use LuaSignal from multiple threads.
- LuaSignal is implemented using debug hooking API that Lua provides. Other
  programs or libraries that also use Lua debugging hooks may miss events that
  occur at the moment a signal fires, because of limitations in the Lua hook
  API. Programs that modify debugging hooks during program execution could also
  exhibit random failures, since they can be interrupted by a signal, which
  will also modify the hooks.
